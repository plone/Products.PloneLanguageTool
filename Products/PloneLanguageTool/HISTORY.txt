Changelog for PloneLanguageTool

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

PloneLanguageTool 1.3 - Unreleased

    - Cleanup switchLanguage.py because it contained a lot of I18NLayer specific code.
      I added the original file to I18NLayer. Also changed .gif to .png in the portlet_languages
      [jladage]

    - Readded flag for Esperanto, we use flag-eo.png as there's no country code.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5547.
      [hannosch]

PloneLanguageTool 1.2 - Released June 1, 2006

    - Readded flag for Basque country, currently we use flag-eu.png as there's
      no official country code in the ISO 3166 standard.
      This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5522.
      [hannosch]

    - Use Central African Republic (cf) flag for Sangho (sg). This closes
      http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5339.

PloneLanguageTool 1.1 - Released May 15, 2006

    - Avoid DeprecationWarning for product_name.
      [hannosch]

    - Replaced the available language selector in the preference panel with a
      new one, which shows both the original and the english language names as
      well as the country flag which might be used for the language switcher
      and the language code. It is possible to sort on any of these criteria as
      well as on the 'selected' status by clicking on the table heading.
      [hannosch] [limi]

    - Removed all language flags in 15x12 GIF format and replaced them with
      16x16 PNG country flags. These are named flag-<country code>.png. The
      country codes follow the ISO 3166 standard. The mapping of flags to
      languages is now more flexibly handled through a new underlying format in
      availablelanguages.py, which would allow to map the same flag to more than
      one language without having to duplicate the file as it was needed with
      the former approach.

PloneLanguageTool 0.9 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Fix http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4959 - if the default language was
      not contained in the supported languages the config form showed a false
      default language and the form had to be saved again to get the desired
      result. Now in this special case the default language is set to the first
      supported language.
      [hannosch]

    - Added removeCountry and removeLanguage methods as counterpart for the
      corresponding add-methods. Added some basic tests.
      [hannosch]

    - Added start_neutral content language setting. Now you can control
      if the content should start as language neutral or in the current
      selected language.
